## `volve-b-well-events.ev`

List of well events, specifically perforations, squeeze and plug-backs identified from a combinations of well reports and forensic analysis of the V2016 model.

Very little information was provided in the original data set about the location and status of completions throughout the field life so there is limited certainty about the validity of these completions. Having said that, these events have been used in the **volve-b** rebuild.

## `volve-b-well-tops`

Petrel style top file for Volve model rebuild. This is not a complete set of tops for every well provided in the original project but for the key wells used in the rebuild.
Interpretation of the intra-reservoir units is based upon well reports where possible or by interpretation using well correlation.

## `volve-b-well-tubing.tub`

Tubing descriptions for well casing.
