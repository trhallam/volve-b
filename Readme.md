# volve-b :: Volve Model Rebuild

This repository houses my work rebuilding a basic model from the [Volve data set](https://www.equinor.com/en/how-and-why/digitalisation-in-our-dna/volve-field-data-village-download.html),
primarily for experimenting with history matching.
If you use any of this work you must follow the terms of the original license
from Equinor ([here](https://www.equinor.com/content/dam/statoil/documents/what-we-do/Equinor-HRS-Terms-and-conditions-for-licence-to-data-Volve.pdf)). I also ask that if you use this data or model that you follow the term for attribution as per the CC-BY license.

The revised model simplifies and removes a lot of the complexity and engineering modifications applied to
the original model (termed V2016) and presents a fresher and easier to understand model that can
be used for further research or teaching.

This model comes with no guarantees. In some cases assumptions have been made from the limited or
inperfect imforation provided with the original data set. I highlight these errors and assumptions where I know they have occurred.

A paper supporting this work is in progress and will be made available when possible.
