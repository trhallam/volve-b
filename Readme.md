# volve-b :: Volve Model Rebuild

This repository houses my work rebuilding a basic model from the [Volve data set](https://www.equinor.com/en/how-and-why/digitalisation-in-our-dna/volve-field-data-village-download.html) for
history matching purposes. If you use this work you must follow the terms of the original license
from Equinor ([here](https://www.equinor.com/content/dam/statoil/documents/what-we-do/Equinor-HRS-Terms-and-conditions-for-licence-to-data-Volve.pdf)).

The model simplifies and removes a lot of the complexity and engineering modifications applied to
the original model (termed V2016) and presents a fresher and easier to understand model that can
be used for further research or teaching.

This model comes with gunarantees and in some cases assumptions have been made from the limited or
inperfect imforation provided with the original data set. I purely ask for attribution where this
model is used as per the CC-BY license.

A paper supporting this work is in progress and will be made available when possible.
